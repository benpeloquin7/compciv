434142251066093568,2014-02-14 01:49:13 +0000,SimonCowell,Thought I should try and explain what really happened. Both fox and us made the decision to protect a very important brand to us.
434141834949173248,2014-02-14 01:47:34 +0000,SimonCowell,Sometimes we rest these shows in other countries. And that's what we did in a crowded market. In most cases the show returned stronger.
434141403963469824,2014-02-14 01:45:51 +0000,SimonCowell,The last time I appeared on X factor uk it resulted in over 45 million record sales. So I decided last year to return home to the uk show.
